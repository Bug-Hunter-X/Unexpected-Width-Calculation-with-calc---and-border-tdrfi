The following CSS rule has an error that is not immediately obvious:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  border: 10px solid black;
}
```

The issue is that the `calc()` function is calculating the width *before* the border is applied.  The border adds 20px (10px on each side) to the element's total width, resulting in a width that's larger than intended. The intended effect is to have the div with a width of 100% of its container, but with a 10px border around it. However, due to the order of operations, this isn't achieved.
